# ViaductAppProject

Viaduct is a simple demonstration-only iOS Application. It shall help backpackers to cover long distance for free by doing ride-share with random drivers. By doing so, drivers do not expect a share of expenses, but instead they can expect social interactions with people from other culture. 

The software serves as a networking service to connect riders with riders (i.e. backpackers) who want to travel to random and unknown locations. 

The software shall provide a platform for users to share without having to share personal contact information. The software will allow riders to request a car. When offering a request, driver can accept or reject it based on rider's 'distance. The software shall not allow third party interception of personal information nor shall it allow release of personal information to unauthorized users. 

The app is build under a MVC pattern and rely on Firebase Client-Server architecure.
